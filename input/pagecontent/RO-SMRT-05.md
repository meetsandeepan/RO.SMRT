This section corresponds to transaction [RO-SMRT-05] of the IHE-RO Technical Framework. Transaction [RO-SMRT-05] is used by the ROIS to report the treatment-plan approval to the TMS.

> **Editor's Note (provisional):** This transaction is in development. The transaction identifier and section number are provisional pending assignment by the IHE-RO Technical Committee. The FHIR message structure will be authored in a subsequent revision. See the [Open Issues](issues.html).

### Scope

This transaction is used by the ROIS, once a plan has been approved for delivery, to communicate that approval to the TMS. The ROIS serves as the gatekeeper for proceeding with treatment delivery; the TMS adds the approval to the plan.
